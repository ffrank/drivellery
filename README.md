on-the-fly web galleries from Google drive

This is currently just an idea: Create a web service that takes a Google drive folder location and returns HTML for a simple web gallery. Could likely be built without an actual service, as a mere JS library. But owning the API can enable some benefits I guess.

Alpha release to be expected around October ;-)
